2. Give a brief example of when to use ID ( #id ) and when to use classes ( .class ) in CSS.

3. What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?
* Red, Green, Blue, Alpha. RGB is used to represent a colour, Alpha is the same as transparency.

4. Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body element?
* Because that way, the css styles loads faster, and you won't experience unstyled elements whilst the file is loaded.
 Also it's against the standard to put it in the body. Other developers working on the code will also expect to find it there.
