            <p>
                My name is Alex, I'm 22 years old and I'm studying informatics. <br>
                In my spare time I like to climb, and slackline.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my first time using HTML. In the past, I've used both Python and C++. <br>
                However, I'm most familiar with ABBs 800xA structured text based on C#, from my past in the automation industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this course I expect to acquire a skill-set that allows me to construct webpages, using HTML, CSS and JS.
