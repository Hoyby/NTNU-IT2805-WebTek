1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed?
    Absolute is placed relative to its parent (if parent is relative) or relative to the page.
    Whilst fixed is placed relative to the viewport. Therefore it will always stay in the same
    place on the screen.
2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
    "some_element" "child_element":nth-child(3) {    }
