1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
	Because OS developers intentionally disable autoplay in order to preserve the users mobile data.
	
2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a
device with 320 x 568 resolution?
	Nothing. The #logo will only hide if the device has a width bewteen 768px and 1024px
	
3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of
dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
	Mobile versions may exclude content or functionality that could have been useful for some users.
	*Some responsive designs may do this aswell, but in a way that keeps the relevant content.
		It may instead remove functionality that is not as needed on mobile devices. 
	Having an extra mobile website also means more maintenance.
